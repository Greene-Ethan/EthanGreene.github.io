# Computer Scientist

#### Technical Skills: Java, SQL, Python, PHP, Azure AI

## Education
- BS, Computer Science | College of Charleston (_May 2025_)

## Work Experience
**AI Developer @ Querri (_January 2025 - Present_)**
- I am interning at Querri to help create natural language processing models.
- Through an agile development model, my team and I are working in 2-week sprints in order to develop AI models.

## Projects
### Web Development

Using PHP, I built the backend of a dynamic website that interacted with an SQL database to authenticate users. Using sessions, users could edit their information, therefore updating the database or registering new accounts, inserting a new user into the database through forms listed on the webpage. 

### Machine Learning Recommender System
[Brief Overview](/assets/img/TripRecc.pdf)

I spent a semester doing exploratory data analysis to identify common trends in large-scale databases. From these trends, my team used machine learning to map out our data so we could recommend relevant criteria to users.

I worked with a team of entrepreneurs to develop a for-profit start-up company with a purpose to change the world for the better. We then pitched our company to a group of angel investors.

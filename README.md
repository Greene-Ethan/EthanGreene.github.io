## Work Experience
**Language Model Fine-Tuning @ Querri (_January 2025 - April 2025_)**

Utilized Python to fine-tune an open-source small language model for Querri, improving code validation and reliability within their AI data analytics. See the links below for the Python code I used to make my model and the actual model itself.

Rotated Scrum Master responsibilities, leading daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to foster collaboration and iterative improvement.

## Projects
### Web Development

Using PHP, I built the backend of a dynamic website that interacted with a MySQL database to authenticate users. Using sessions, users could edit their information, therefore updating the database or registering new accounts, inserting a new user into the database through forms listed on the webpage. Please see my video demo of the website and the code listed below.

### Machine Learning Recommender System

Conducted semester-long exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in large-scale datasets, enabling effective machine learning–based recommendations. Below is a presentation-style overview of some of the accomplishments from this project.

### Impact X 

As part of a semester-long course, I collaborated with a team to develop a for-profit startup focused on social impact. Led aspects of product development and strategy, and pitched the final concept to a panel of angel investors. Below is a link to the CofC page about Impact X for more information.

### Foundational Java Datastructures Implementation

Implemented core data structures in Java from scratch—including [linked lists](assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/LinkedListADT.java), dynamic [array lists](/assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/ArrayListADT.java), [binary search trees](/assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/BST.java), [min heaps](assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/MinHeap.java), and [hash tables](assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/HashTable.java)-to strengthen understanding of memory management, algorithm efficiency, and data organization.

### Memory Simulator
Implemented memory allocation simulations in C, demonstrating best fit, next fit, and first fit strategies for dynamic RAM management.

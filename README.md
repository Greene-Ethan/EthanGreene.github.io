## Work Experience
**Language Model Fine-Tuning @ Querri (_January 2025 - April 2025_)**

Utilized Python to fine-tune an open-source small language model for Querri, improving code validation and reliability within their AI data analytics.

## Projects
### Web Development

Using PHP, I built the backend of a dynamic website that interacted with an SQL database to authenticate users. Using sessions, users could edit their information, therefore updating the database or registering new accounts, inserting a new user into the database through forms listed on the webpage. 

### Machine Learning Recommender System
[Brief Overview](/assets/img/TripRecc.pdf)

I spent a semester doing exploratory data analysis to identify common trends in large-scale databases. From these trends, my team used machine learning to map out our data so we could recommend relevant criteria to users.

I worked with a team of entrepreneurs to develop a for-profit start-up company with a purpose to change the world for the better. We then pitched our company to a group of angel investors.

### Foundational Java Datastructures Implementation

Implemented core data structures in Java from scratch—including linked lists, dynamic array lists, binary search trees, min heaps, and hash tables—to strengthen understanding of memory management, algorithm efficiency, and data organization.

### Memory Simulator
[Code](https://github.com/Greene-Ethan/EthanGreene.github.io/blob/main/assets/code/MemorySimulator/mem.c)

Implemented memory allocation simulations in C, demonstrating best fit, next fit, and first fit strategies for dynamic RAM management.

## Work Experience
**Language Model Fine-Tuning @ Querri (_January 2025 - April 2025_)**

Fine-tuned a small language model (SLM) using supervised learning techniques to identify variables in Python code. Leveraged Hugging Face Transformers to enhance code validation and accuracy for internal AI data tools.

Key Contributions:

- Fine-tuned a small language model to recognize and label variables in Python source code.

- Designed and implemented supervised learning pipelines using Hugging Face’s Trainer and Transformers.

- Developed preprocessing and postprocessing logic to optimize code parsing and variable recognition.

- Evaluated model performance with validation metrics, error analysis, and testing datasets.

- Rotated Scrum Master responsibilities: led stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

- Collaborated with a team to integrate model outputs into production-grade analytics systems.

## Projects
### Web Development

Built the backend of a dynamic website using PHP and MySQL. Implemented session-based user authentication, enabling users to register, log in, and securely update their personal information through form submissions.

Key Contributions:

- Designed and implemented PHP backend logic to connect and interact with a MySQL database.

- Created secure user registration and login workflows using session management.

- Developed forms for user input, enabling dynamic updates to database records.

- Ensured proper user access control and database integrity through validated inputs and error handling.

### Machine Learning Recommender System

Conducted semester-long exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in large-scale datasets, enabling effective machine learning–based recommendations. Below is a presentation-style overview of some of the accomplishments from this project.

### Impact X 

As part of a semester-long course, I collaborated with a team to develop a for-profit startup focused on social impact. Led aspects of product development and strategy, and pitched the final concept to a panel of angel investors. Below is a link to the CofC page about Impact X for more information.

### Foundational Java Datastructures Implementation

Implemented core data structures in Java from scratch—including [linked lists](assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/LinkedListADT.java), dynamic [array lists](/assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/ArrayListADT.java), [binary search trees](/assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/BST.java), [min heaps](assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/MinHeap.java), and [hash tables](assets/code/DatastructuresImplementation/HashTable.java)-to strengthen understanding of memory management, algorithm efficiency, and data organization.

### Memory Simulator
Implemented memory allocation simulations in C, demonstrating best fit, next fit, and first fit strategies for dynamic RAM management.

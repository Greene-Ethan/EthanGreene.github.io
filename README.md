## Projects
### Web Development

Using PHP, I built the backend of a dynamic website that interacted with an SQL database to authenticate users. Using sessions, users could edit their information, therefore updating the database or registering new accounts, inserting a new user into the database through forms listed on the webpage. 

### Machine Learning Recommender System

I spent a semester doing exploratory data analysis to identify common trends in large-scale databases. From these trends, my team used machine learning to map out our data so we could recommend relevant criteria to users.

I worked with a team of entrepreneurs to develop a for-profit start-up company with a purpose to change the world for the better. We then pitched our company to a group of angel investors.
